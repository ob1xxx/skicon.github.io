### What is SNOWcon

SNOWcon is different from most cybersecurity conferences you have heard of or attended. 
First, it changes venue every year and plan to travel around the world! 
Second, it will heavily focus on the social aspect of the event and promote physical activities. Don't worry if you never done snow sports before, we will work with the ski resorts and sponsors to offer classes for all range of skiers and riders. 

The idea came from the now retired [SkicCon](https://skiconne.org) that focussed on Ski/Snow and [Obective-by-the-Sea](https://objectivebythesea.org) that changes location every year.
