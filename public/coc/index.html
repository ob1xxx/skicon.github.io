<h3 id="who-is-our-code-of-conduct-for">Who is our Code of Conduct for?</h3>
<p>Ski Con aims to be a conference for everyone; that means we run a zero-tolerance policy on harassment against anyone, for any reason. We expect all event attendees, speakers, sponsors, partners, vendors, facilities staff, committee and board members to agree to and follow code of conduct guidelines. Should you have questions, concerns or doubts about whether an action would be in violation of the CoC, please contact organizers at skiconne [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>
<h3 id="publication">Publication</h3>
<p>The Code of Conduct is available online at <a href="https://www.skiconne.org/code-of-conduct">https://www.skiconne.org/code-of-conduct</a> . Printed versions of the Code of Conduct will be made available at all official Ski Con events and activities, and links to the Code of Conduct will be supplied on all official Ski Con community forums and chat rooms.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>Security events present opportunities to learn, share knowledge and network. As a security event organizer, we believe these events should represent a safe, enjoyable and inclusive environment for all people, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexuality, religion, disability, socioeconomic background, experience, size, shape and so on. No one should undergo harassment, bullying or abuse. Any sign of such behavior will be deemed unacceptable and will be handled in line with our zero-tolerance policy. We will apply consistent, specific sanctions regardless of the circumstances to ensure they do not recur. This code of conduct explains exactly what we mean by unacceptable behavior and it outlines the steps someone subjected to such behavior at an event can take to report it.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-we-need-a-code-of-conduct">Why do we need a Code of Conduct?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, unacceptable behavior still occurs and while harassment metrics are yet to be introduced and measured, anecdotal reports are widespread and have been reported in the media and social media platforms for years. This has reportedly resulted in increased dissatisfaction and non-attendance by some minorities who feel disenfranchised and threatened. The purpose of this code of conduct is to get participants fully aligned on what constitutes unacceptable behavior, how the aggrieved can report it, and what will be done about it.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-define-acceptable-and-unacceptable-behavior">How we Define Acceptable and Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
<p>People’s interpretation of acceptable or unacceptable behavior is subjective and influenced by personal experience, religion and cultural background. That’s why we believe it’s important to define what we mean by both.</p>
<h3 id="acceptable-behavior">Acceptable Behavior</h3>
<p>As an event organizer, we expect everyone to be professional and respectful to others at all times. Everyone should be aware of the impact their behavior can have on others. We ask that you</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect the venue, the staff and any equipment you may be allowed to use.</li>
<li>Be courteous and well-mannered when speaking to someone or engaging with them.</li>
<li>Treat people the same way you would like to be treated.</li>
<li>Respect someone’s personal space and body – when someone says no it is no, not maybe.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unacceptable-behavior">Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
<p>Unacceptable behavior is offensive in nature – it disturbs, upsets or threatens. It lowers self-esteem or causes overwhelming torment. It is characteristically and can take the following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Derogatory, inflammatory or discriminatory language, comments or conduct.</li>
<li>Engineered episodes of intimidation, aggressive actions or repeated gestures.</li>
<li>Repetitive heckling and disruption of talks.</li>
<li>Presenting staff or volunteers in inappropriate attire e.g. sexualized clothing.</li>
<li>Using sexual images or sex toys in public spaces.</li>
<li>Inappropriate photography or recordings (where inappropriate is defined as used later in a sexual, derogatory or defamatory manner or for exploitation).</li>
<li>Stalking or following.</li>
<li>Persistent and unwanted sexual advances.</li>
<li>Unwanted physical contact.</li>
<li>Encouraging any of the above behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alcohol-and-other-substances">Alcohol and Other Substances</h3>
<p>The following substance-related conduct is also prohibited:</p>
<pre><code>Excessive or irresponsible consumption of alcohol;
Possession, sale, or use of marijuana, any marijuana derivative, or any other illicit or controlled substance other than under the prescription and supervision of a licensed physician (Ski Con prohibits the use of marijuana and derivative products at its events, even when validly prescribed by a licensed state authority. Ski Con may require documentary proof of other prescriptions.) ;
Providing or participating in the service of alcohol to anyone under the legal drinking age, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; and
Smoking, except in designated areas.
</code></pre>
<p>Ski Con’s contracted Venue providers reserve the right to further prohibit the use or possession of drugs (legal, prescription, or other), tobacco, or other substances on their property, per the terms of the rental contract.</p>
<h3 id="photo-video-and-recording-policy">Photo, Video, and Recording Policy</h3>
<p>Ensure you have the permission from anyone you photograph or record. This includes those in the background of your shot. “Crowd shots” from the front (facing the crowd) are not allowed.</p>
<p>If you’ve accidentally taken a picture without permission, delete it. If you are asked by a participant to delete/blur a picture they did not give you permission to take, please do so immediately.</p>
<p>Upon a first infraction, you will receive one warning from Ski Con Staff. Upon a second infraction you will be asked to give up your device to Ski Con Safety for the duration of the event or to leave the event with your device, your choice. You may return to the event once you have deposited your device in a secure location, offsite.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-report-unacceptable-behavior">How to Report Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
<p>Option 1: Speak up. See it, say it, sort it.</p>
<p>If you are disrespected, or witness this happening to someone else, engage politely with the person involved, if you feel able to, and let them know that you find their behavior unacceptable and offensive. Sometimes the best way to change unacceptable behavior is by bringing it to the perpetrator’s attention and giving them an opportunity to acknowledge this and apologize.</p>
<p>Option 2: Report it to us via any of the following ways:</p>
<pre><code>Inform a member of our event staff who can be identified by their badge.
Email us at skiconne [at] gmail [dot] com
Complete our event feedback form (this can be done anonymously), which will be sent out to all attendees after the event concludes.
</code></pre>
<p>When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible, preferably:</p>
<pre><code>Your name and contact details (email, cell/mobile phone and address).
The time it occurred.
The place it occurred.
The names and contact details of any witnesses.
The outcome you are expecting (e.g. letter of apology, steps taken to prevent a similar instance from occurring etc.)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: you can remain anonymous if you so wish and providing any of the above information is optional.</p>
<p>Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please report the situation to us as indicated above.</p>
<p>We don’t have a time limit for reporting unacceptable behavior, although we encourage you to do it as quickly as possible, as it can be difficult to obtain accurate witness statements the longer time passes. If you report unacceptable behavior more than 3-months after an incident, you should explain why as it may impact the ability to respond accordingly. We will consider your explanation and then endeavor to deal with your report.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-handle-unacceptable-behavior">How we Handle Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that you experience a positive, enjoyable and inclusive event. We strive for customer service excellence when reporting unacceptable behavior. That’s why, for the duration of our event, we will have a number of reporting mechanisms available (e.g. suitable informed event staff, event feedback forms etc.). When you report unacceptable behavior to us, we will respond promptly and with care, consideration and respect. Our process does not replace nor remove the formal mechanisms available to you as an individual to report inappropriate or offensive behavior such as making a police report. Our process is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>We will acknowledge your report and reply via email (if an email was sent) as soon as is practical.
We will perform a thorough investigation starting immediately. We will not comment on your experience or perception of it. We will keep it wholly professional and confidential. We will treat all of the people involved fairly and objectively, irrespective of what our relationship with them is.
We will apply the appropriate sanctions / remediation e.g. warnings, direction to learning resources on the topic of harassment, bullying or anti-social behavior, temporary or permanent suspensions, and if necessary, report them to the police. We will take into consideration your wishes in any enforcement.
We will suggest measures we can take to ensure incidents of this nature do not recur at future events.
We reserve the right to remove people from the event or prevent people from joining the event.
We will not name and shame individuals, but we will analyze our progress with regards to unacceptable behavior and publish our findings annually on our website.</code></pre>
